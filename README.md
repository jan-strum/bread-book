# Description

A recipe book application intended for sourdough bread bakers. Eventually, I intend to turn this application into a social media platform for sharing recipes of all kinds, but for now, you can find a list of some of the intended basic features below.

### Intended Features

- Auto-calculation of baker's percentages for hydration levels and for each ingredient.
- Convert times for each task (e.g. mixing, autolyse, etc.) given a start or end/bake time.
- Ability to use and customize recipe templates.
- Ability to save ingredients for easy lookup and reuse.
